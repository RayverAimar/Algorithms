# Algorithms


## Overview

Here, there are some stored algorithms. This repository is a collections of implementation of a variety of algorithms (from diferent topics) made up in C++.

## Features

* All of these algorithms implementations are in this general purpose language - [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
* The C++ standard used to implement these algorithms is [C++17](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17).
* These algorithms are purposely using [STL](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) classes and [containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container). It is not using external libraries for compilation or execution.
